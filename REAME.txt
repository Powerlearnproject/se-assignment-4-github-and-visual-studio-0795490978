Question 3

Key Concepts of Version Control with Git

1. Repository (Repo):
        A repository is a storage location for the project files and their version history. Git repositories can be local (on your machine) or remote (on a server, such as GitHub).

2. Commit:
        A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. Each commit records the state of the files and directories, along with a message describing the changes made. Commits create a historical record of the project's evolution.

3. Branch:
        A branch is a parallel version of the repository. It allows developers to work on different features or fixes simultaneously without affecting the main codebase. The default branch in Git is usually called main or master.
        Branching enables isolated development environments for new features, bug fixes, or experiments.

4. Merge:
        Merging is the process of combining changes from different branches into a single branch. This is a common step after a feature is complete or a bug fix is ready for production.
        Git provides tools to handle conflicts that may arise when merging changes.

5. Pull Request (PR):
        A pull request is a way to propose changes to a codebase. It allows developers to review the changes, discuss them, and approve or request modifications before merging them into the main branch.
        Pull requests are a key feature of platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

6. Clone:
        Cloning is the process of creating a local copy of a remote repository. This allows developers to work on the project locally.
        The command git clone <repository-url> is used to clone a repository.

7. Push and Pull:
        Push: The command used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. This updates the remote repository with local changes.
        Pull: The command used to fetch and integrate changes from a remote repository into the local repository.

8. Remote:
        A remote is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. The most common remote is origin, which refers to the original repository that was cloned.

9. Staging Area (Index):
        The staging area is a place where changes are prepared before a commit. It allows developers to review changes and selectively stage specific files or changes for the next commit.
        The command git add <file> is used to add changes to the staging area.

10. .gitignore File:
        A .gitignore file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git. This is useful for excluding temporary files, build artifacts, and other non-essential files from version control.
